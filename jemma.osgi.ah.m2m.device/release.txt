	- Fixed/updated local container address management
	- Fixed wrong version number in M2MConstants class

Version 1.2.11:
	Features: 
	- Changed management of m2m connection protocol version system property ("it.telecomitalia.m2m.device.enableProtocolVersion"): 
	now only when this property is not available or setted to false the protocol version management is disabled
	- Now the CommandProvider service register also the osgi.command.scope property that is set to m2m.
	  With this modification the console commands works also under Prosyst. Provided that the

Version 1.2.10:
	Features:
	- Added xml data type (ah schema) for appliance statistics logs

Version 1.2.9:
	Features:
	- Backported to JRE 1.5	(replaced String.isEmpty() method with a custom method )

Bundle Version 1.2.8:

	Features: 
	- Added a system property to enable client version in m2m connection protocol ("it.telecomitalia.m2m.device.enableProtocolVersion")

	Misc:
	- Simplified XML schema (A@H classes include E@H specific classes and schema is now generated by modifying java classes)

Bundle Version 1.2.7:

	Misc:
	- Generic M2M and Hap client API and service refactoring 

Bundle Version 1.2.6:

	Misc:
	- Generic API refactoring 
	
Bundle Version 1.2.5:
	
	Features:
	- Added optional version management in m2m connection protocol and xml schemas
	- Modified keep-alive protocol (now id and nwkSclId are optional in xml schema and 
	not used by m2m device)
	- Modified uri used for content instances queries (appended "QUERY" keyword to URI 
	when a prototol version is specified)
	
	Misc:
	- General refactoring on jaxb context and namespace intitialization 
	- Added it.telecomitalia.m2m.eh package with containers descriptor (moved here from 
	ESP Bundle) and e@h XML schema files
	- Added some javadoc documentation to xml schema files	
	- Removed RestClient class now included in OSGi utils bundle
	
Bundle Version 1.2.4:
	Bugfix:
	- A problem related to the loading of deviceToken property from configuration file has been fixed 
	- Some properties in ConnectionParameters element are now optional and not used in keep-alive mechanism (m2m connection xml schema file)
	- An error in DeviceConnectionParameters elements' name has been fixed (m2m connection xml schema file)

	Features:
	- Ported on Apache Felix and Prosyst mBS OSGi frameworks 
	
	Misc:
	- Added a method to get relative addressedId url to M2MContainerId class 
	- Changed error and warning log messages (stacktrace is now printed by the logger) 
	- Some options in the build.properties file have been added to manage plugin export without E@H and A@H specific 
	classes (these options are commented in the default version of the build.properties file)
	- The authentication mechanism has been simplified for all gateway ids not included in the E@H trial/pre-trial: 
	the password must be explicitly configured by using the API (or a system property) and is currently stored without 
	encryption in the generated property file
	- A dedicated class (EHSettings) has been added to manage E@H trial specific parameters: it is currently used to 
	manage the authentication of all E@H trial/pre-trial gateways
	- Added some javadoc documentation to xml schema files
	
Bundle Version 1.2.3:

	Bugfix:
	- Fixed synchronization problem in addReference and removeReference methods of M2MDeviceManager class (now these methods are synchronized on

Bundle Version 1.2.2:
	Features:
	- Updated connection authentication mechanism (now based on encryption)
	- Exported m2m current connection informations through M2MDevice interface
